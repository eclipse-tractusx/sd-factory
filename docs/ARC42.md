## Architecture Constraints

### Self Description Data Model

The data model of Gaia-X is not finally defined yet, but is a live document with permanent changes. The latest 
information are available [here](https://gaia-x.gitlab.io/policy-rules-committee/trust-framework/participant/#provider).
Therefore, it was aligned with Gaia-X that the Self Descriptions' claims contain a small set of properties such as

Version 0.1 (October 2021 as mentioned in a Workshop together with Pierre Gronlier)

*   service\_name: the service provider (Operating Company)
*   service\_provider: the service provider (Operating Company) 
*   product\_provider: the product provider (the company providing this service): For shared services this will be Catena-X or the operating company in the name of Catena-x. 
*   governance\_law\_country: the service provider

Version 1.0 (based on the [Trust-Framework])

* company\_number: Country’s registration number which identify one specific company.
* headquarter.country: Physical location in [ISO 3166-1](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html)
  alpha2, alpha-3 or numeric format.
* legal.country: Legal location in [ISO 3166-1](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html)
  alpha2, alpha-3 or numeric format.
* service.provider: a `provider`‘s URL which provide the service
* bpn: the business partner id

For Catena-X release 2.0 we aligned with GAIA-X to adhere to
[Trustframework v22.04](https://confluence.catena-x.net/download/attachments/25223149/Gaia-X-Trust-Framework-22.04.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1658315527264&api=v2), 
thus providing self descriptions for

*   Legal person
*   Service offering
*   Data exchange connector service

**LegalParticipant**

* **registrationNumber**: Country’s registration number which identify one specific company.
* **headquarterAddress.country**: Physical location in [ISO 3166-1](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html)
  alpha2, alpha-3 or numeric format.
* **legalAddress.country**: Legal location in [ISO 3166-1](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html)
  alpha2, alpha-3 or numeric format.

additional attributes for Catena-X purpose

*   bpn: the business partner id

**ServiceOffering**

* **providedBy:** a resolvable link to the participant self-description providing the service (see SD LegalParticipant)
* **termsAndConditions**: a resolvable link to the Terms and Conditions applying to that service
* **policies**: a list of policy expressed using a DSL (Rego or ODRL)
* **aggregationOf:** (optional) a resolvable link to the resources self descriptions related to the service and that
  can exist independently of it.

**TermsAndConditions structure**

*   URL: a resolvable link to the document
*   hash: sha256 hash of the above document

For Catena-X release 3.0 we aligned with GAIA-X to adhere to
[Trust Framework V.22.10], providing self descriptions for

*   Legal person
*   Service offering


### GX-Compliance Service

GAIA-X will also provide a service to proof for compliant self descriptions 
([https://gitlab.com/gaia-x/lab/compliance/gx-compliance](https://gitlab.com/gaia-x/lab/compliance/gx-compliance)).


## System Scope and Context

The Portal provides the necessary information to the SD Factory in plain text format via
API. SD-Factory creates the JSON-LD document and provides it to the 
Compliance Service. After processing, Compliance Service sends Self-Description back to the Portal.

## Business Context

![](images/image1.png)

## Technical Context

The following pictures show the relevant conceptual model with the entities of interest. For organizations, we do not
have to consider Natural Persons, but only Legal Persons. Each of these entities does have some mandatory but also some
optional attributes.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    Resource <|-- PhysicalResource
    Resource <|-- VirtualResource
    Resource <|-- InstantiatedVirtualResource
    Resource o-- Resource
    Resource o-- ServiceOffering
    ServiceOffering --> Participant : providedBy
    Participant <|-- LegalParticipant
    Participant <|-- NaturalPerson  
```
  
To get them filled we provide a service factory for each of the entities. Hence, we have a subclassing hierarchy. 
The abstract instance provides the general feature to get things signed, either a part of the self-description or 
the whole self-description. In both cases, a string in JSON-LD format is passed to a wallet and gets signed by 
its private key and will be returned as String as signed JSON-LD.

		VirtualResource --> AF
		InstantiatedVirtualResource -->AF
	end
	
```

The documents SD-Factory can
work with are defined in [Trust Framework]. SDFactory supports schema from different
versions of [Trust Framework] depending on the endpoint address.
Take a look at the section describing [REST interface](#REST Interface) for details.
Currently, these documents are supported by SD-Factory:
- LegalParticipant (API v1.0.6, [Trust Framework V.22.10])
- ServiceOffering (API v1.0.6, [Trust Framework V.22.10])
- PhysicalResource ([Trust Framework V.22.10])
- VirtualResource ([Trust Framework V.22.10])
- InstantiatedVirtualResource ([Trust Framework V.22.10])


## Solution Strategy

### The process for creating SD-Documents:

#### Step 1: Creation of LegalParticipant for each company
*   Each SME or Company has to have an SD-Document. This SD document has to be created during the on-boarding process.
*   Concretely, we have to create the LegalParticipant for those companies:
    *   SMEs,
    *   Enterprises,
    *   and Third-Party Provider

Example LegalParticipant

![](images/image4.png)

*   The SD-Document of a company's LegalParticipant is signed by the Catena-X Wallet.

#### Step 2: Creation of PhysicalResource for the place where the service (e.g. connector) will running

* Each service need a data center or cloud tenant where the service will be deployed. This is the Physical 
  resource of the service
* The PhysicalResource contains a list of Participant who maintaining the service and the location (country)

Example PhysicalResource:

![](images/image5.png)

The Physical Resource is created by the operator of the service (connector). The operator will use his wallet 
to sign this SD-Document.

#### Step 3: Creation of Service Offering and InstantiatedVirtualResource for each connector:

*   Pre assumptions:
    *   SD-Document: LegalParticipant of connector operator is already existing
    *   SD-Document: PhsicalResource of the Connector is already existing
*   creation of InstantiatedVirtualResource for each connector
*   creation of ServiceOffering for each connector

![](images/image6.png)

*   The SD-Document of the connector will be signed by the Company Wallet (e.g. T-Systems wallet).

## REST Interface

The SD-Factory provides interfaces to create Verifiable Credential for one of mentioned documents.
Only the authorized user can call these interfaces. They are protected with keycloak. The configuration
parameters are given in `application.yml`.
The user role for creating Self-Descriptions is specified in `application.yml` as well

To trigger creation of the SD-document one shall call the endpoint available by path :

`POST /api/rel3/selfdescription`

OpenAPI specification is given there:

[Pre-22.4 schema, AKA 1.06](../src/main/resources/static/SDFactoryApi-vRel3.yml).

An example of the body for LegalParticipant is given bellow:

```json
{
  "type": "LegalParticipant",
  "holder": "BPNL000000000000",
  "issuer": "CAXSDUMMYCATENAZZ",
  "registrationNumber": [
    {
      "type": "local",
      "value": "o12345678"
    }
  ],
  "headquarterAddress.country": "DE",
  "legalAddress.country": "DE",
  "bpn": "BPNL000000000000"
}
```

The Self-Description in the format of Verifiable Credential is created. Here is an example of
Verifiable Credentials for LegalParticipant:

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
    "https://f1c82785-5598-41c7-a083-01a8e1a80e19.mock.pstmn.io/ctxsd"
  ],
  "type": [
    "VerifiableCredential"
  ],
  "id": "5096f9c2-24fd-43c5-9d50-e43a409ebb33",
  "issuanceDate": "2023-07-26T17:07:31Z",
  "expirationDate": "2023-10-24T17:07:31Z",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "bpn": "BPNL000000000000",
    "registrationNumber": [
      {
        "type": "local",
        "value": "o12345678"
      }
    ],
    "headquarterAddress": {
      "countryCode": "DE"
    },
    "type": "LegalParticipant",
    "legalAddress": {
      "countryCode": "DE"
    }
  },
  "issuer": "CAXSDUMMYCATENAZZ"
}
```    

## SD-Documents for Release 2:

In agreement with Portal, we will only create the LegalParticipant SD-Document for CX-Participants and ServiceOffering for Connector

**CX-Release 2.0 (to be discussed with Portal-Team whether this reduces the amount of work or not for first step)**

> Proof, whether SD-Hub is able to provide a resolvable link to a registered SD artifact, e.g like _**[https://sdhub.catena-x.de/sd?bpn=xyz](https://sdhub.catena-x.de/sd?bpn=xyz)**_
>
> If this is possible, everything is fine and in the dialog this resolvable link had to be provided.
>
> If this is not possible, wenn instead of providing the link, we had to provide the data separated by semicolons for each attribute provided within the linked SD artifact.
>
> Example for this modified linking:
>
> Sample data for ServiceOffering:
> 
> instead of   
> providedBy="_**[https://sdhub.catena-x.de/sd?bpn=xyz](https://sdhub.catena-x.de/sd?bpn=xyz)**_"  
we send  
providedBy="registrationNumber="123456";headquarterAddress.country="DE";legalAddress.country="DE";bpn="CAXSDUMMYCATENAZZ";issuer="CAXSDUMMYCATENAZZ";holder="CAXSDUMMYCATENAZZ""

## Runtime View

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    User-->>Identity Provider: authentication
    User->>Onboarding Service: participant data
    Onboarding Service-->>Identity Provider: technical user

    SDFactory->>+Compliance Service: Unsigned Verifiable Credential
    Compliance Service->>Compliance Service: asynchronous processing
    Compliance Service->>+Onboarding Service: Signed Verifiable Credential
```

Here the flow of Self-Description creation is shown:

1. A user is authenticated in Identity Provider service on behalf of a company
   and receives the authentication ticket.
2. User calls On-boarding Service with request for creating and publishing
   SD-document. The service authenticates the user and prepare the data
   SD-Factory needs for creating SD-document. SDFactory takes document in a format,
   specified in OpenAPI document [Pre-22.4 schema, AKA 1.06]  and convert it to
   [Trust Framework V.22.10]. Currently, these documents are supported by SD-Factory:
    - LegalParticipant;
    - ServiceOffering;
3. On-boarding service (OS) calls SD-Factory for creating SD-document passing this
   data as a parameter. OS uses a credential with a role allowing for this request
   (e.g. `add_self_descriptions`, the default role for SD-document creation). The
   credential for this operation is taken from Identity Provider (keycloak).
4. SD-Factory creates a Verifiable Credential based on the information taken from
   On-boarding Service
5. SD-Factory sends unsigned Verifiable Credential to the Compliance Service for further
   (asynchronous) processing. Compliance Service is responsible for verification of the VC
   and signing. In the end the Compliance Service sends Self-Description
   document back to the On-boarding service endpoint. OS is responsible for storing and
   publishing it.
